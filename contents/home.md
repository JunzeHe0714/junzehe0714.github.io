I’m currently an undergraduate student at Central South University, and my major is statistics.The 
picture on the upper right corner was taken in August 2024 at the Super Nintendo World in Universal Studios Japan. 
It is very interesting there! I'm standing inside that green chimney. 

I am grateful to have begun my research journey under the guidance of Professor [Jinbiao Wu](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/wujinbiao/zh_CN/index.htm) at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University, 
during my sophomore year, with a primary focus on operations research and optimization.
