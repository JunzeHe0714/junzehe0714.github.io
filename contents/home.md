Hi, My name is Junze He. I am an incoming PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, starting in September 2026, supervised by [Prof. Ziye Ma](https://gavenma.github.io).

Currently, I am an undergraduate student at Central South University, and my major is statistics.

During my sophomore year, I am grateful to have begun my research journey under the guidance of Professor [Jinbiao Wu](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/wujinbiao/zh_CN/index.htm) at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University, 
 with a primary focus on operations research and optimization.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I serve as the Co-COO of [HeartCert](https://heartcertai.com)(**归心认证**), a startup dedicated to reshaping talent benchmarks in the AI era. At HeartCert, we address the inefficiencies of repetitive labor in traditional recruiting, 
connecting enterprises with the right talent while issuing "Competency Passports" for high achievers.
