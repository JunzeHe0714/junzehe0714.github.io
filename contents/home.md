I’m currently an undergraduate student at Central South University, and my major is statistics.

During my sophomore year, I am grateful to have begun my research journey under the guidance of Professor [Jinbiao Wu](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/wujinbiao/zh_CN/index.htm) at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University, 
 with a primary focus on operations research and optimization.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I serve as the Co-COO of [HeartCert](https://heartcertai.com)(归心认证), a startup dedicated to reshaping talent benchmarks in the AI era. At HeartCert, we address the inefficiencies of repetitive labor in traditional recruiting, 
connecting enterprises with the right talent while issuing "Competency Passports" for high achievers. Our company is currently valued in the tens of millions of RMB—a testament to the capital market's recognition of our vision.

We believe that "only those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do."
